# Example for the Ross-Li BRDF parameterization; radiances are calculated for an empty 
# atmosphere to demonstrate the angular distribution of the  reflection.
# The example reproduces test case 14d in the DISORT3 release.

# Note that due to the combination of no_scattering and no_absorption
# the single scatering albedo is set to 1.0 which implies that dnet flux/d op dep
# does not agree with test case 14d which has single scattering albedo of 0.0.
